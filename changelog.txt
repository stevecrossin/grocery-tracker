Sunday 15 December - Steve C

* Overall project structure - created folders for files to be sorted into (e.g. screens, entities for DB entities, database for the definition of database)

*Worked on Data Validation 

Saturday 28 March - Steve
* Receipts.java - deprecated method to upload PDF files to Firebase, started integration of tested code to convert PDF to CSV. In standalone test, was able to convert PDF to CSV, having some file permission/conversion issues that
are still in progress, and have been noted in bugs.txt.

Sunday 29 March - Steve
* Receipts.java
- fully depreceated and commented out Firebase upload to PDF functionality.
- wrote methods to handle PDF to CSV conversion. At the moment, this writes the PDF that's accessed from file storage to temporary storage within the application to enable conversion, prunes irrelevant data and retains any
information in the PDF table. Writes this to a timestamped CSV file. Still working on insertion into application database. Need to comment methods/functions (this is noted in the TODO section.
- Renamed Items tables to Receipts, created table structure & getter/setter methods and constructors.
- Updated bugs.txt with resolved issues, and this changelog.txt with changes made.
