Changelog - please add all changes you make here at the end of each coding session.

Format needs to have - your name, day, date, the files that you worked on, and changes you made to them. First entry is an example.

Sunday 15 December - Steve C

* Overall project structure - created folders for files to be sorted into (e.g. screens, entities for DB entities, database for the definition of database)
* Created AppDataRepo & AppDB - these form the basic structure of the applications database and defines the tables in that database.
* Created Login & MainActivity with basic pseudocode to explain their functions.
* Created tables for grocery items (Items.java/ItemsDao.java, User.java/UserDao.java and created basic constructors, getter/setter methods and defined the rows in each table based on old ERD diagram).
* Created changelog (this file), to do list, and bugs file, which are for documenting changes made, overall tasks that need doing (and who is working on them), and bugs observed (which need to be marked resolved, NOT deleted, once they are resolved.)

Sun 5 Jan - Steve
* Fixed bug causing crash - commented out code
* Implemented sign-up button and onClick to Sign Up screen./..

Tuesday - remediation

Wednesday 8 Jan - Steve - login code
Login.java
* Implement login code, this checks existing user fields in DB and either allows login, returns error that pass is wrong, or user doesnt exist.
** Performs this by hashing the entered password in the password entry and comparing with hashed password in user DB.
* Checks if user is already logged into app and will skip login task and proceed direct to Main Activity

Signup.java
* Re-designed UI, and changed the way that data is stored (passwords are now hashed).

Other
* Added ability to logout in main activity, added appropriate DB operations.
* Other layout/style changes
* Updated changelog, other notes.

11 Jan
Steve rewrote receipts function.


22 March
Test Commit by Radika to feature/dataValidation

Saturday 28 March - Radika & Steve
*Worked on Data Validation 

Saturday 28 March - Steve
* Receipts.java - deprecated method to upload PDF files to Firebase, started integration of tested code to convert PDF to CSV. In standalone test, was able to convert PDF to CSV, having some file permission/conversion issues that
are still in progress, and have been noted in bugs.txt.

Sunday 29 March - Steve
* Receipts.java
- fully depreceated and commented out Firebase upload to PDF functionality.
- wrote methods to handle PDF to CSV conversion. At the moment, this writes the PDF that's accessed from file storage to temporary storage within the application to enable conversion, prunes irrelevant data and retains any
information in the PDF table. Writes this to a timestamped CSV file. Still working on insertion into application database. Need to comment methods/functions (this is noted in the TODO section.
- Renamed Items tables to Receipts, created table structure & getter/setter methods and constructors.
- Updated bugs.txt with resolved issues, and this changelog.txt with changes made.
- Updated todo file.

3 April - Steve 
Code maintenance - merged work completed by Amie and Ben in /UnitTesting and /dynamicNotifications branch.

3-4 April - Steve
- Completely rewrote how receipts are handled. They are now inserted into DB and linked to users DB with foreign key, so when user logs in, it will load their, and only their uploaded receipts.
- Created new view (ViewReceiptsActivity) that allows user to see history of receipts they uploaded, and the items they purchased. Does this by using a recycler view/cardview, and placing each receipt in the DB into a separate list item,
so this can be shown in the list individually.
- Refined UI, tidied code. Some commented out code needs to be removed/depreceated
- Some basic testing of functionality is now complete.
- Updated bugs list, changelog and todo.

Full detail of changes:

- Changes to build.gradle - update dependencies to AndroidX, add cardview implementation for future code.
- Updated AppDataRepo.java, UserDao.java and Login.java - use new DB mechanism to get user by email provided during login, rather than iterating through entire list in DB - cleaner and quicker to run. Commented out old code for now to show changes made.
- Implementation of ability for uploaded receipt to be saved to RoomDB, and initial logic for user to view their receipts
    - Created foreign key relation on receipts table with user table such that each receipt will be associated with a user.
    - Added logic to save a receipt row after creating it's csv file with it's name, file path, creation time and the associated user.
    - Added UI to view list of saved receipts for a logged in user. The UI will display the name and creation time of each receipt.
    - Refactored and removed unused code.
- Implementation - ability to view receipt contents.
    - Tapping on a receipt in receipts list screen will open another screen with the contents of that receipt, showing the line items the line items in the Receipt.java
Done by creating adapter for the receipt line items, new XML files for these layouts, amendments to other screens, creating records in receipt DB from parcel.

- Adjustments - fixing bugs and adjust UI/make enhancements
    - Signup.java - Fixed issue where login status of newly signed up user was not being updated.
    - Display receipt name and time in view receipt contents screen.
    - Fixed receipt time view such that it is centered vertically in comparison to receipt name.
    - Added padding to the right of receipt item description so that it doesn't look stuck to the edge at the right/end.
    - ReceiptItemsAdapter.java - quantity of items was coded as a decimal, changing this to an integer.

    Also rearranged/tidied code.

* Final changes - adjusting the view receipt view to show the total of all items (is at bottom of activity, and show dollar sign. Final total to be to 2 decimal places.

    Also, updated bug list, changelog and todo.

Still needs to be done:
- Test UI changes - Amie to look at splitting the sign up screen into a few views/test functionality
- Ryan to look into uploading DB contents to room DB.
- Radika to redo UAT
- Ben to investigate and explore notifications more fully to explore alternate ways this can be used
- Rest to do testing/documentation of solution

22 April - Ben
Added code to log event when Share Receipts button is pressed. Dynamic notifications only present when event is logged, allowing for notifications to be presented at certain screens

22 April - 23 April - Steve
* Session 1 -
- UserReceipt.java - created superclass containing Receipts and User classes, in order to pass data from user and receipts table to firebase in same method.
- /entities/User - added otherUser constructor for purposes of passing to firebase
- AddReceipt.java - updated writeCSVFiletoFirebase method to pass all data from user table for current user.

Todo: still need to work on PDF extraction to string with comma and semicolon separatation, and pass that up to Firebase instead of receiptFilePath upload code

23 April - Steve
* Session 2 -
- AddReceipt.java - receipts now correctly uploading receipt contents, removed pushing of user info into receipt upload.
- Signup.java - wrote method to push newly created users in RoomDB to Firebase into separate User entity.

25 April - Steve
- activity_main.xml - created alternate landscape layout to fix UI bugs bleeding over etc.
