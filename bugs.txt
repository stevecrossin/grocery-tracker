Document any bugs observed while coding here.

You need to notate:
* In which file the bug exists (e.g. screens/Login.java
* The error message you observed (if any)
* What behaviour the application exhibits when this bug occurs.

As bugs are resolved, they need to be marked as resolved and move to the resolved list to enable regression testing (do not delete resolved bugs)
