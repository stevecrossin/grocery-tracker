Document any bugs observed while coding here.

You need to notate:
* In which file the bug exists (e.g. screens/Login.java
* The error message you observed (if any)
* What behaviour the application exhibits when this bug occurs.

As bugs are resolved, they need to be marked as resolved and move to the resolved list to enable regression testing (do not delete resolved bugs)

/** ACTIVE BUGS **/
Signup.java/Login.java - due to no data validation on email address/sign up, user can sign up for an account with password that doesn't comply with password length rules, but then not be able to sign in.


/** RESOLVED BUGS **/
Login.java - AppDb initialisation causing crash (probably DB not setup correctly, need to resolve)
Receipts.java - While methods have been written to convert PDF to CSV, actual conversion of PDF file is not working and is not correctly accessing file. Needs further work. Resolved in commit 226e8fa79ea.
