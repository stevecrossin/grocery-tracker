Will my shopping data be distributed to third parties?

No. All information collected will be de-identified. We will keep track of your data by using a random unique identification number that no third party will have access to. Even in de-identified form we will not release your data to anyone other than the research team.
Your data will not be used for any other purposes other than public health research purposes of the research team at Deakin University.


What if I forget to upload my receipt for a weekly shop?

You can go back to the email you received after completing your shop and log this through the application at any time.

I do not want to be part of this study anymore, how do I withdraw?

Simply send feedback through the application that you wish to withdraw from the study. You will receive email confirmation once this has been completed.
